 Heffernan Tawn Mixture Model as in Tendijck et al (2021)

This code is aimed to be supplementary material to Tendijck et al (2021).

This folder contains two main .m files:
	1. tutorial.m which demonstrate how to use most of the important functions that we wrote
	2. runApplication.m demonstrates the functions applied to an oceanographical application, see Tendijck et al (2021)
